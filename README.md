Numc
This is a console C application written using MS Visual Studio Community 2019 originally.
It has been loaded into GitHub as a test of Git so that I may learn what it is all about.
I used the Visual Studio functionality to do this (given that GitHub is owned by Microsoft!)

The application is meant to solve the Numbers part in the Numbers and Letters TV show.
Given six integers, using the 4 basic operations + - x and /, and each number at most once generate a given integer
Eg. 666 can be generated using 100, 75, 25, 10, 7 and 5 as follows :
((100+75+10)x(25-7)/5) = 666
((100+75+10)x(25-7)/5) = 666
((((100-7)x(25+10))+75)/5) = 666

It will find ALL unique solutions accounting for commutivity and associativity. If none exists it will tell you so!
